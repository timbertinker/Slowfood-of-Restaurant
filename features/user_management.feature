Feature: As a visitor
So that I can log in to the system and place orders
I would like to see a 'log in' or 'register' button on the home page.

Scenario: Allows a visitor to access a registration page
  Given I am on the "home page"
  And I click on the "Log In" link
  Then I should be on the registration page
  When I fill in "Username:" with "user"
  And I fill in "Password:" with "user"
  And I click "Log In" button
  Then I should see "Successfully logged in user"
